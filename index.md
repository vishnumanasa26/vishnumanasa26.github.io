<p style="text-align: justify">Vishnu Manasa Devagiri is currently working as a Project Assistant at the Department of Computer Science, <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.bth.se/"> Blekinge Institute of Technology</a>, Sweden. She completed her Ph.D. in May 2024 from the same university under the guidance of <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.bth.se/staff/veselka-boeva-vbx/"> Prof. Veselka Boeva </a> and 
<a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/niklas-lavesson-nla"> Prof. Niklas Lavesson</a>. The focus of her Ph.D. study is to explore unsupervised or semi-supervised learning algorithms suitable for analyzing evolving and/or heterogeneous data. The developed algorithms were transparent, making it easier to understand the results. Her research interests include machine learning, data mining, multi-source learning, data stream mining, interpretable and explainable AI. She has experience in working with real-world industrial research problems in diverse domains. During her Ph.D. studies, she collaborated with companies like iquest, Sony, and EluciDATA Lab, Sirris. Before starting her Ph.D. at BTH, she worked as a software developer in the industry for around two years. Manasa received her Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden, in 2017 and a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.jntucek.ac.in/">Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University</a>, Kakinada, India.</p>
