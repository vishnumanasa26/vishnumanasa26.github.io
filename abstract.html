title: "Mining Evolving and Heterogeneous Data: Cluster-based Analysis Techniques"
---

<p align="justify">A large amount of data is generated from fields like IoT, smart monitoring applications, etc., raising demand for suitable data analysis and mining techniques. Data produced through such systems have many distinct characteristics, like continuous generation, evolving nature, multi-source origin, and heterogeneity, which are usually unannotated. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group and analyze unlabeled data. Conventional clustering algorithms are unsuitable for dealing with data with the mentioned characteristics due to memory, computational constraints, and their inability to handle heterogeneous and evolving nature. Therefore, novel clustering approaches are needed to analyze and interpret such challenging data.</p>

<p align="justify">This thesis focuses on building and studying advanced clustering algorithms that can address the main challenges of todayâ€™s real-world data: evolving and heterogeneous nature. An evolutionary clustering approach capable of continuously updating the generated clustering solution in the presence of new data is initially proposed, which is later extended to address the challenges of multi-view data applications. Multi-view or multi-source data presents the studied phenomenon or system from different perspectives (views) and can reveal interesting knowledge that is not visible when only one view is considered and analyzed. This has motivated us to continue exploring data from different perspectives in several other studies of this thesis. Domain shift is a common problem when data is obtained from various devices or locations, leading to a drop in the performance of machine learning models if they are not adapted to the current domain (device, location, etc.). The thesis also explores the domain adaptation problem in a resource-constraint way using the cluster integration techniques proposed. A new hybrid clustering technique for analyzing heterogeneous data, which produces homogeneous groups facilitating continuous monitoring and fault detection, is also proposed.</p>

<p align="justify">The algorithms or techniques proposed in this thesis are evaluated on various data sets, including real-world data from industrial partners in domains like smart building systems, telecommunications, and performance monitoring of industrial assets. The obtained results demonstrated the robustness of the algorithms for modeling, analyzing, and mining evolving data streams and/or heterogeneous data. They can adequately adapt single and multi-view clustering models by continuously integrating newly arriving data.</p>
